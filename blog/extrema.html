            <h1>extrema</h1>
            <p>
                In 2023 I started thinking a lot about scale. Specifically, the scale at which to approach an optimization problem. Speifically specifically, when I try to optimize something, whether I am actually going for the global optimum, or simply collecting many local optima that will fail to be as good as a more broad strategy.<br>
                To translate into plain english, a strategy for local optimization might dictate that you should lift weights every single day if you want to get stronger. Indeed, you will probably get a little stronger each day if you do this. However, according to widely agreed upon science, it's actually much better to lift weights a few times a week with plenty of rest in between, if you goal is to get as strong as possible in the least amount of time. The sum of the local optima in this problem is fundamentally disjoint from path to the ultimate maximum. <br>
                Untold years of my life so far have been spent on this kind of relentless forward progress, the sisyphean pursuit of getting a little bit better every single day. Every single goddamn day of my life, when I was beaten down physically and mentally, I would still push because I thought it was the only way I could ever succeed. To be frank, it was more, I deeply feared I would be a worthless failure as a person if I did not complete my daily tasks, which variously included reading 100 pages, running 3-5 miles, eating 1 pound of vegetables, consuming 150 grams of protein, drinking 64oz of water, and other unpleasant yet laudable things in the vein of "self improvement". <br>
                With the gratuitous amount of money and free time and peace of mind I have been lucky enough to find after exiting my college years and entering into corporate america, I have had more space to think about my pursuits of the past. Without so much time pressure on me, I have started to think more about the big picture, and if I am actually heading towards the global maximum in terms of living a good life and doing well at the things I care about. It was only when I had ample time and space that this could have occurred to me, so I appreciate how it may seem unintuitive. <br>
                So far, I have had great success in redirecting my goals and practices to do what will truly serve me in the long long term. <br>
                One of the most striking examples is that I slowed down my training runs by 1-2 minutes per mile and started running very easy. After about a month of this, I was suddenly able to run at a previously "hard" pace like it was nothing, and the length of my long runs has tripled.<br>
                I also stopped forcing myself to get through an entire book every week. I am now allowing myself to drop things that I don't find interesting or useful, and this has allowed me to find much greater meaning and entertainment from the material I do stick with. <br>
                 Paradoxically, I been making leaps and bounds in my personal pursuits by doing a lot less, taking it easy, and resting. I have made more progress in months than I had in entire years prior, and it's clear to me now that I was looking to solve the wrong problem. I might not make progress every day anymore, but with patience and ... laziness(?) I have now been able to break through previously impassible with no trouble at all. The freshness of being well rested is so precious to me now that I won't let go of it again.
