                Is measurement necessary for improvement? Further, is the process of measuement alone sufficient to make improvements? Having recently read some books that make this claim, I was inspired to try it for myself. I decided to just start measuring things and see what would happen, without necessarily having a specific goal in mind. <br>
                After a two month hiatus after getting surgery, I had a renewed focus on improving my general health. I first started to wear a heart rate monitor (on my garmin) to keep track of daily activity. All of a sudden, I started ditching my usual commute on the subway to a commute on a citibike, because I liked what that did for my numbers.<br>
                Second, as I started running again, I started uploading my workouts to strava. This also made me want to go out much more often, even if the posts were private and nobody could see them except me. I started slowly pushing the maximum distance of my long runs, and posting them gave me a renewed sense of inspiration each week. I mentally committed to the "no two days off" rule and have stuck to it since.<br>
                On the road to get monthly blood tests this year, I also started focusing more on key biomarkers that I could adjust through my diet. Remembering to take supplements was easier when I knew I would be able to actually see that they were working in a few weeks.<br>
                I also started tracking my weight. It's not my goal to lose a significant amount of weight, but I did want to get an idea of how training was changing my diet. <br>
                One key thing to remember is that absolute values in the measurements are not really significant. Most measuement devices available to consumers have a high degree of inaccuracy. For example, the scale at home and at my doctor may read out my weight as over 10 pounds apart, and that does not mean I gained or lost any weight. However, when measuring with the same inaccurate device over and over, a trend line can be observed. More important than the absolute number is the trend, and this directional line is most important.<br>
                Directionally, I am making improvements. I am taking this all much slower than I have done in past efforts to improve my health. I have a longer horizon in mind for when to expect results. I am not sure if this extra patience is an accidental effect of just getting older or actual improvement from my efforts, but I'll take it.<br>
                So far, the simple tactic of "just measure" has worked. Without a specific goal in mind but rather a directional trend, I feel less pressure to achieve something quickly, which I hope will contribute to the formation of long term (perhaps even lifelong) habits. As long as I am steering myself in the right direction, I will get the results I want naturally, without much effort. <br>
